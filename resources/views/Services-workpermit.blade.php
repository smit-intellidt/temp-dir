                                            The best way to obtain a work permit in Canada is by immigrating to this country and applying for Permanent Residency. When you have Permanent Residency, you are allowed to work for as long as you would like and have access to public health services, as well as, free education for your children. We can help you through this process. The first step in order to obtain your Permanent Residence is to have an initial immigration consultation. Afterwards, we will offer you the most efficient immigration plan based on your profile.

                                            During your consultation, one of our regulated immigration consultants licensed by ICCRC (Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council) will analyze your options to immigrate into Canada. If you already qualify for an immigration program to Canada we can proceed with your immigration plan.

There are two processes that allow the companies to do this: Provincial Nominee Programs (PNP) and Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA).

                                            There are different phases throughout the immigration process. They include the eligibility phase, immigration application, required documentation gathering, and all the procedures that are involved before the visa is issued. Doing all of these phases on your own is a lot of work and also extremely risky, since a simple mistake can affect your chances of success. Therefore, the best option is to rely on the assistance of a Canadian immigration consultant to manage all the phases of your immigration application.

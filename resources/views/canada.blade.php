                <h3 class="font-head-it pr-2">Vancouver ranks as the top 3rd best city in the world for quality of living and the best city to live in North America.</h3>

                <p class="par-p pr-2">
                    Located in the beautiful British Columbia, Vancouver is well known for its natural beauty — large and plentiful trees, mountain ranges, and coastal views across the city’s skyline.  Located on the pacific west coast, Vancouver is surrounded by water. The city's coastline offers amazing views and great beaches, while the mountains offer hiking trails and snow sports. Vancouver is a very multicultural city, home to large Chinese and South Asian communities. The economy is growing quickly, especially in the high-tech sector, financial services, film production, education, and natural resources. It has a diverse, metropolitan area, yet you’re always close to nature. Vancouver’s peaceful and calm demeanor, outdoor lifestyle, and comfortable climate, is why Vancouver is consistently voted as one of the most livable cities in the world. </p>
